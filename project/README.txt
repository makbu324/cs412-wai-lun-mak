Dear Grader, 

Thank you so much for grading my work!! I just have a few requests when testing my website.

When adding songs and adding learned chords, 
I would recommend waiting for 15-30 seconds before doing so...

If you see a "database is locked" message, that means the website is still processing your request...
You may wait for a few seconds and reload the page if you see that.

(If you don't mind, testing on a local computer would be completely bugless!)

Thank you for your kind understanding...

Have a fantastic break too!
Mak
